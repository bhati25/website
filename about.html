                      expenses with the amount of money students have in hand.
                      When curating the list of expenses, they must begin with
                      considering fixed, irregular and regular costs. The fixed
                      costs include tuition fees, hostel and mess charges and
                      phone bills, irregular costs include charges incurred on
                      books or study material of every semester and the regular
                      costs include expenditure on dining out or other
                      miscellaneous charges. After preparing the list of
                      expenses the students should compute the amount of money
                      they will have in hand for allocating towards different

                    unnecessary expenditures. Similarly, international students
                    must know hands-on ways to manage their expenses wisely to
                    avoid any kind of cash crunch and save for unplanned

                    >To buy the study materials or books of different semesters,
                    the students can take them on a sharing basis with their
                    roommates/classmates. This way the total money gets split in
                    half and no one bears the full costing. The option of
                    second-hand books is also available.</span

                    any other entertainment activities, the students can carry
                    their ID cards as they may get discounts through it. Also,
                    carrying a student ID while going out is recommended for
                    security purposes.</span

                    commuting using public transport, munch on street foods and
                    shop in local markets.</span
                  ><br class="about-text276" /><span

                    account and take a sim card when they come to pursue higher
                    Study in India. Having an account here will smoothen all of
                    their transactions.</span

                    overwhelming. With some planning, organization, and
                    diligence, studying abroad doesn’t have to be a financial
                    burden though. Students should start planning ahead of time
                    and make sure they are fully prepared before leaving.
