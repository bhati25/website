                    minds and move to another country to pursue higher
                    education, planning the budget comes into play right away.
                    This is because while studying, students usually have a
                    limited budget in hand. Therefore, planning and creating a
                    student budget gives clarity about expenses, amount
                    allocation and most importantly, saving for unplanned

                    institution fees etc., travel cost and other miscellaneous
                    expenses. While education costs may be further divided into
                    admission fees, tuition fees and educational supplies,
                    purchase of laptop, travel expenses would usually include
                    visa permits, airfare, day-to-day travelling (if any).
                    However, the significant costs include accommodation, food,
                    transports, and other personal day-to-day expenses.
                    Therefore, students have to take care a lot, when it comes
                    to managing their expenses. Under such situations,
                    affordability is a factor that acts in favour of students.
                    Therefore, the students coming to study in India are at an

                    the necessary things they would require while staying in

                    original academic documents, electronic devices, and

                    recommended to check the weight limits of their respective
                    flights and pack the luggage accordingly to avoid any last-
                    minute hassle. Moreover, while packing the clothes, students
                    should consider two points, the first being prevalent
                    climatic conditions and the second, if formal clothing is
                    required in their allotted institutes/courses. Last but not
